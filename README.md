# Racing Game

*The goal of this project was to build a racing game using all of the combined skills we've developed thus far in class. The racing game has two players that compete to see who can get to the finish line (a time portal) first.*

## Technologies Used

*jQuery*
*Javascript*
*HTML*
*CSS*

## Existing Features

*Two racers compete to see who can get to the finish first. When a player wins, the game alerts that the player has won, and adds a win to their win counter.*

## Planned Features

*Scrolling Background using HTML5 canvas*
*Add Sprite obstacles that reset the user's position when they collide*
